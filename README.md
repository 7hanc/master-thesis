## Conclusions 
* We proposed EC server federation formation mechanism to maximize the profit in each federation and ensure stable federation. 
* We consider pay-per-use payments for users and heterogeneous service costs for EC servers and support users propose locality requests.
* Our simulation results show that, in most of the federation settings
  * MPF strategy can earn more profit than other strategies.
  * MPF strategy may serve less resource's request than LSF strategy.
